# Colour-Switch-Demo

Colour Switch Demo is a 2D Unity game developed with the concept of popular [Color Switch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.colorswitch.switch2&hl=en) app published by Color Switch Pheonix LLC.
The goal of the game is to pass maximum number of obstacles possible by continously tapping to avoid the ball dropping out of screen. obstacles contain parts of four different colours from which the ball can pass through
only when it has the same colour as the colliding part. after each obstacle colour of the ball will be randomly switched by a switcher on the way. Obstacles are selected from a pool randomly and generated dynamycally.
Passed obstacles are destroyed off screen to avoid any lag due to large number of game objects.
